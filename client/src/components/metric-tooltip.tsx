  },
  "24h-apy": {
    title: "24-Hour APY",
    description: "The current yield rate based on the last 24 hours of performance. This can fluctuate daily based on market conditions and protocol activity.",
    example: "Higher activity often means higher yields, but also more volatility."
  },
  "30d-apy": {
    title: "30-Day Average APY",
    description: "The average yield over the past 30 days, providing a more stable view of the pool's performance over time.",
    example: "This smooths out daily fluctuations to show longer-term trends."

    title: "Total Value Locked (TVL)",

      "high": "Higher potential returns but increased risk of loss"

  "operating-days": {
    title: "Operating Since",
    description: "How long this pool has been active. Longer operating periods can indicate greater stability and proven track record.",
    example: "365 days means the pool has been running for about one year."
  },
  "impermanent-loss": {
    title: "Impermanent Loss",
    description: "A temporary loss in dollar value compared to holding assets separately. This occurs when token prices change relative to each other in liquidity pools.",
    example: "If you provide ETH/USDC and ETH price doubles, you'll have less ETH than if you just held ETH."
  },
  "liquidity-pool": {
    title: "Liquidity Pool",
    description: "A collection of funds locked in a smart contract that provides liquidity for decentralized trading. Users earn fees from trades.",
    example: "You deposit tokens, traders use your liquidity, you earn a share of trading fees."
  },
  "yield-farming": {
    title: "Yield Farming",
    description: "The practice of lending or staking cryptocurrency to earn rewards. You provide liquidity and receive tokens or fees in return.",
    example: "Like earning interest at a bank, but with cryptocurrency and often higher rates."
  },
  "smart-contract": {
    title: "Smart Contract Risk",
    description: "The risk that the automated code governing the pool has bugs or vulnerabilities that could lead to loss of funds.",
    example: "Code is audited, but there's always some risk with complex financial contracts."
  },
  "defi": {
    title: "Decentralized Finance (DeFi)",
    description: "Financial services built on blockchain technology that operate without traditional intermediaries like banks.",
    example: "Lending, borrowing, and trading directly between users using smart contracts."

  "protocol": {
    title: "Protocol",
    description: "The underlying platform or application that hosts the yield opportunity, like Uniswap, Aave, or Compound.",
