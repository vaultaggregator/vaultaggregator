Replit, restyle my Vite + Tailwind app to match the UX and density of vaults.fyi. Use these pages as layout reference only. Do not copy code or assets.

Keep my data, APIs, SWR keys, and services unchanged. Do not touch Holder count logic.

Theme and shell

Default to light theme. Add a dark toggle in the top bar.

Fixed left sidebar about 220 px with icons and labels. Items: Discover, Dashboard, Swap, Admin.

Top bar with search on the right.

Neutral background. Subtle borders. Small text. Tight spacing.

Content max width 1280 and centered.

Discover page

Replace cards with a dense table like vaults.fyi. Columns in this order: Token, Protocol, Chain, Net APY, TVL, Holders, Risk, Updated at. 
app.vaults.fyi

Row height about 44 px. Font about 13 px. Right align number columns.

Sticky header. Sticky filter row under the header.

Filters as pills: chain, protocol, token, rewards. Sync selection to URL query.

Sorting on APY and TVL. Client side first. Hook ready for server sort later.

Detail page

Split header in two columns. Left meta: token name, protocol badge, chain badge, risk tag. Right: action card placeholder. Follow the clean layout from the vault page reference. 
app.vaults.fyi

Tabs: Overview, Activity, Holders.

Overview shows two mini charts only, APY and TVL, height 240 to 260, thin grid, 12 px labels. 
app.vaults.fyi

Yield breakdown block: base APR, reward APR by token with small badges. Short fee notes.

Show Updated at near header stats and above charts.

Dashboard page

Small stats across the top: total TVL, average net APY, vault count, Updated at.

Two compact panels below: performance chart and allocation by protocol. Match the density shown in the reference dashboard. 
app.vaults.fyi

Swap page

Keep it as a visual placeholder that matches the shell and form styling. No routing logic now.

Holders and Activity

Activity tab lists only ERC-4626 Deposit and Withdraw rows. Columns: Time, Type, User, Assets, Shares, Tx. Keep your existing service and filter.

Holders tab shows top 20 addresses. Columns: Rank, Address chip with copy, Balance, Percent, Updated at. Add a thin percent bar.

Components to add or refactor

AppShell with Sidebar and Topbar.

DataTable with sorting and pill filters.

Badge and Tag components.

PillFilter.

MiniChart wrapper.

AddressChip with copy.

UpdatedAt label that reads SWR timestamps.

Typography and spacing

Use an 8 px spacing grid.

Body 13 px, secondary 12 px, titles 16 px.

Tabular numerals for numbers. Truncate long text with ellipsis.

Soft color badges for chain, protocol, risk.

Performance and UX polish

Serve built assets from dist with compression and long cache for hashed files.

Lazy load chart code on the detail page.

Downsample long time series to about 600 points before rendering.

Raise admin status polling to 10â€“30 seconds. Add a 5 second microcache on the status endpoint.

Show Updated at on table, charts, holders, and activity.

Keep your Delta flash on number changes.

Responsiveness and accessibility

Sidebar collapses on small screens.

Table can scroll horizontally on narrow screens. On very small screens, switch to a two-line row layout.

Focus styles on table rows and pills. Keyboard navigation across filters and tabs. Aria labels on icons.

References handling

During development only, fetch each reference URL once, strip scripts and inline styles, and save snapshots under references/html for spacing cues. Do not ship these files.

Do not change

Business logic.

Services and SWR keys.

Holder count logic.
