# âœ… Working PM2 Access Methods

## ðŸŽ¯ Primary Access (Web Interface)

**Admin Dashboard - Copy this URL:**
```
https://dc10b6b7-3fe2-4be7-8e53-bc83c302b4eb-00-334oy17bcobqc.janeway.replit.dev/admin
```

This gives you:
- Real-time service monitoring
- Service configuration controls
- Manual triggers
- Error logs and status

## ðŸ“Š What You'll See in the Admin Dashboard

Your active services:
- **poolDataSync** - Running every 1 minute âœ…
- **holderDataSync** - Running every 10 minutes âœ…  
- **morphoApiSync** - Running every 5 minutes âœ…
- **alchemyHealthCheck** - API monitoring every 2 minutes âœ…

## ðŸ”§ Why PM2 Monitor Port 3001 Doesn't Work

The PM2 monitor server (port 3001) is only accessible locally within the Replit environment. External URLs can only access your main application (port 5000).

## ðŸ’¡ Alternative: Command Line Access

If you need direct PM2 commands:
```bash
pm2 list                    # View all processes
pm2 logs poolDataSync       # View service logs
pm2 restart poolDataSync    # Restart a service
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Bottom Line

Use the admin dashboard URL above - it's the working web interface for PM2 monitoring via your external Replit domain.
