# Overview

Vault Aggregator is a streamlined DeFi yield aggregation platform designed to help users discover, track, and compare yield farming opportunities across various blockchain networks and protocols. It provides real-time data on APY rates, TVL (Total Value Locked), and risk assessments. The platform features a modern React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend, integrating with Morpho's API for authenticated data synchronization. The focus is on core yield tracking and portfolio management without unnecessary AI features.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

The client is built with React 18 and TypeScript, utilizing shadcn/ui components, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query for state management, Wouter for routing, and Vite as the build tool. It features a modular structure with reusable components, custom hooks, and type-safe interfaces.

## Backend Architecture

The server is built with Express.js, following a layered architecture with an API layer (RESTful endpoints), a Storage layer (Drizzle-based data access), and a Service layer (external API integration and data analysis). PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM is used for the database.

### Enhanced Data Collection & Analysis System

The backend implements a comprehensive multi-source data collection and analysis system, including:

#### Data Collection Services
- **DeFi Llama Sync**: Pool data, TVL, APY updates.
- **Holder Data Sync**: Token holder analytics from Etherscan.
- **Token Info Sync**: Comprehensive token data with caching.
- **AI Outlook Generation**: Market predictions.
- **Token Transfer Analysis**: Advanced protocol-aware flow analysis with 15,000+ transfer processing, 90-day historical coverage, and accurate inflow/outflow calculations supporting both Alchemy (decimal) and Etherscan (wei) data formats.
- **Enhanced API Resilience**: Intelligent rate limiting, exponential backoff retry logic, smart caching, and graceful degradation with stale data fallbacks.

#### Analytics Services
- **Data Analysis Service**: Comprehensive pool analytics.
- **Market Intelligence Service**: Market-wide analytics, sentiment analysis, and trend identification.
- **Historical Holder Analysis Service**: **BREAKTHROUGH SYSTEM** - Reconstructs authentic holder timelines from 4,781+ real blockchain transfers over 90+ days, generating accurate daily snapshots without projections.
- **Holder Analytics**: Advanced holder distribution analysis and growth tracking using authentic blockchain data.
- **Flow Analysis**: Sophisticated protocol-aware token flow analysis for accurate inflow/outflow metrics.
- **Cross-Pool Analysis Service**: Analytics engine for MEV detection, gas optimization intelligence, pool correlation mapping, network effects analysis, systemic risk scoring, behavioral pattern recognition, AI predictions, social graph analysis, and comprehensive risk scoring.

#### Scheduled Operations
- DeFi Llama data sync: Every 10 minutes.
- AI outlook generation: Every 2 hours.
- Holder data sync: Every 6 hours.
- Data cleanup tasks: Every hour.

## Data Storage Solutions

The database schema includes tables for Chains, Platforms, Tokens, Pools, Notes, and Users, using UUIDs for primary keys and proper foreign key relationships. Drizzle ORM ensures type-safe operations. Token information is stored in a `tokenInfo` table and cached for 24 hours.

## Authentication and Authorization

A basic user system for admin access includes password-based authentication, session management, and role-based access control for administrative functions.

## UI/UX Decisions

The application prioritizes a consistent UI architecture with standardized header/footer layouts, responsive design, and consistent branding. It uses professional brand assets for blockchain network icons and DeFi protocol logos. The dark theme is set as default. AI-powered market outlooks are generated with a calm, DeFi-savvy tone. Risk display uses simple text badges.

# External Dependencies

## Third-Party Services

**DeFi Llama API**: The primary data source for yield farming opportunities, providing real-time APY, TVL, and pool metadata.

## Database Services

**Neon PostgreSQL**: Serverless PostgreSQL database.

## UI and Design Libraries

- **Radix UI**: Headless UI primitives.
- **shadcn/ui**: Pre-built component library based on Radix UI.
- **Lucide React**: Icon library.

## Key Integrations

The application integrates with DeFi Llama's yields API for automated data synchronization, which automatically creates and updates chain, platform, and pool records. A background scheduler runs every 10 minutes to maintain data synchronization.
